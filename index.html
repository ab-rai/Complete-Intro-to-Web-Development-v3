        <h4>What you say</h4>

            Attributes allow you to modify behavior of an HTML attribute. You've already seen a few of them but we'll go into a few more examples of them.

        <p>
            A really good example we have seen already is the href attribute of the <a href="https://www.google.com"> masters</a> tag. By modifying the href we're modifying what the tag does. It's contextual as well: href only works on a tags. You can't add a href to a div and expect to suddenly work as a link.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another one we say is the type attribute on the input. By changing the type you're changing what sort of input is being show
